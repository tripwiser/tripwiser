# TripKit Subscription System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Property 'isPremium' doesn't exist error
**Root Cause**: The user store was updated to use `subscriptionTier` instead of `isPremium`, but several components were still referencing the old property.

**Files Updated**:
- `src/screens/TemplatesScreen.tsx` - Updated premium checks and upgrade prompts
- `src/screens/TripSetupScreen.tsx` - Replaced `isPremium` with `currentTier === 'free'`
- `src/screens/TravelTipsScreen.tsx` - Updated all premium feature checks
- `src/screens/QuickTripSetupScreen.tsx` - Updated premium validation
- `src/screens/LoginScreen.tsx` - Updated user object creation with `subscriptionTier`
- `src/screens/SignUpScreen.tsx` - Updated user object creation with `subscriptionTier`
- `src/screens/PremiumScreen.tsx` - Added redirect to new SubscriptionScreen

### 2. Subscription Service Updates
**Enhanced Features**:
- Added action mapping in `canPerformAction` method
- Support for string-based action names (e.g., 'createTrip', 'sharePackingList')
- Proper feature key resolution for different subscription tiers

### 3. Component Integration
**Updated Components**:
- **AdBanner**: Now checks `adFree` feature from subscription tier
- **UpgradePrompt**: Integrated across all feature-gated screens
- **PackingListScreen**: Updated sharing limits and collaboration features
- **AddJournalEntryScreen**: Added journal entry limits enforcement
